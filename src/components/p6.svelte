    These are our proposed changes to the Triton Alerts that we are currently receiving. Firstly, we think it is crucial to add a 
    map of the location so that it is more clear to all academics, staff, and students if they are in a dangerous area that they 
    should vacate. We also think we should include a list of crimes that happened in the area recently so that they can make an 
    informed decision.
